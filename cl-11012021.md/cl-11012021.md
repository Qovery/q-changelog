# November 01st, 2021 Release
---
Welcome to the 2nd changelog! For the past two weeks, our team was very busy working on the product in order to improve the user experience and fixing bugs that were reported by our community, we also had the time to implement a pretty cool feature that will probably make your life easier.


## ADDED - Clone environement 

With the button "Clone" you can now duplicate an existing environment with one click, this also include the database and all the secrets variables linked but because a video speak more than a thousand words, [here](https://www.loom.com/share/8255d3747f3b4b6cb13f0e0c5808330b)  is a demo of this new feature.


## ADDED - Quickstart section 

With this extra section, you'll learn how to deploy your application with Qovery with several frameworks, this include:

* Meilisearch
* Django
* Spring boot
* Rust
* Laravel
* Rails

You can find all all about it [here](https://hub.qovery.com/docs/using-qovery/quickstart/) 


## CHANGED - Optimisation of logs 

The logs used to be quite slow and laggy to display but thanks to our frontend team it's no longer the case.


# Smaller improvements and fixes
* FIX - Some logs messages were send twice to the UI due to CoreV1 sending message on several NATs
* FIX - You can now create an app in an environment if you don't have webhooks permission 
* FIX - Url target now forward after login
